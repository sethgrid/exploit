# Exploit Example

Inspired by this thread:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17636032

I intended to create an exploit where if you curl an endpoint it provides a bash script, and if you pipe that output it provides a different bash script. One commenter said that you could do this with a curl back to the hosting server.

Results:
Mixed. I can send chunked data, but bash does not execute each line that is passed to it as it receives it.

### running locally

```
go run main.go
```

In a new tab:
```
curl localhost:5050/download
curl localhost:5050/download | bash
```

If the exploit works, you will get two separate outputs. On my mac, it is the same output as bash seems to not execute until the original curl finishes.
